        <h1>Charlie's Milk Steak</h1>
        <img src="/assets/milk-steak.jpg" alt="beef steak boiled in milk, with jelly beans" />

        <h3>A scrumptious steak dinner, best served with free-range jelly beans</h3>
        <p>
            The preferred meal of Charlie Kelly, from "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia".<br />

            Only the finest cuts of beef should be used, and is delicious when served immediately, or after fermenting
            in the trash for a week.
